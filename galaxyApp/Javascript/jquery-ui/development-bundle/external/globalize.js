	// than Spanish in Spain. A "neutral" culture is one that is not
	// specific to a region. For example, the culture "es" is the generic
	// Spanish culture, which may be a more generalized version of the language
	// that may or may not be what a specific culture expects.
	// For a specific culture like "es-CL", the "language" field refers to the
	// neutral, generic culture information for the language it is using.
	// This is not always a simple matter of the string before the dash.
	// For example, the "zh-Hans" culture is netural (Simplified Chinese).
	// And the "zh-SG" culture is Simplified Chinese in Singapore, whose lanugage
	// field is "zh-CHS", not "zh".
